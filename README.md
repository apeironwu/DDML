# DDML
distributed double machine learning




## Simulation 

### Simulation 1

partial linear regression model with known error density

parameter setting: 
- number of sites: $K = 5$
- sample size of each site: $n = 100$,
- dimensionality of covariates: $p_\beta$, 
- error density: normal distribution with variance $\psi_u$ and $\psi_v$, 
- 

comments: 
- no machine learning model, no overfitting, no data splitting.


questions: 
- correlation between $U$ and $V$ in data generation?
